# lua calculator thingy
A (definitely very original) CLI text calculator written entirely in Lua, complete with binary operations ➗, parenthesis (), the constant pi ⭕, and meta-commands 😱❗❗💯


## Getting started

It's really simple actually, just download the repo and execute it with Lua (`lua calc.lua`), it's not that hard... unless you don't have Lua on your computer 🤔.
